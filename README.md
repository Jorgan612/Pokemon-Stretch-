## Abstract
	Our goal was to build a React app with Typescript and the PokeApi. Our app allows users to view pokemon by generation or all at once. Users can search for a pokemon by name and their search results will filter in real time. If a user clicks on a pokemon card it will show the user that pokemon's details. Users will also be able to favorite pokemon that will show up on a seperate `favorites` page. 

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - React
  - Typescript
  - VScode
	- PokeApi
  - React Router v6

## Wins
	- App styling is on point. 
  - Our app functions the way we intended it to. 
  - Good communication and workflow.  

## Challenges + Improvements
	- Learning a new language is difficult. 
	- Styling on favoriting button within the favorites view is not consistent (but the functionality is there!).
	- Passing state around makes it difficult to keep track of the data used within different parts of the app.


## Future Iterations
  - Comparison feature to compare type strengths and weaknesses between pokemon.
  - The ability to search by properties other than name.
