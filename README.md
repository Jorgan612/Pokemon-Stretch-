## Abstract
	Our goal was to build a React app with Typescript and the PokeApi. Our app allows users to view pokemon by generation or all at once. Users can search for a pokemon by name and their search results will filter in real time. If a user clicks on a pokemon card it will show the user that pokemon's details. Users will also be able to favorite pokemon that will show up on a seperate `favorites` page.
